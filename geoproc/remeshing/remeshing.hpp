/**
 * @brief Remeshes a triangle mesh using harmonic map coordinates.
 *
 * First, computes the harmonic maps parametrisation of the mesh, which
 * yields a set of 2d coordinates in the xy plane, more concretely in
 * the square [0,1]x[0,1] (regardless of the shape).
 *
 * Then, in this square is generated a NxM grid of points. The point
 * \f$P_{ij}\f$ (with \f$1\le i < N, \quad 1\le j < M\f$) has coordinates
 * \f$(x(P_{ij}), y(P_{ij})) = (i/N, j/M)\f$.
 *
 * Each of these points is located in the triangulation obtained from the
 * parametrisation. That means, that we know the triangle of the
 * triangulation each point of the grid is in.
 *
 * With this information, for each point in the grid \f$P_{ij}\f$, inside
 * triangle \f$t_k\f$, the algorithm computes the contribution of the
 * vertices of \f$t_k\f$ to make point \f$P_{ij}\f$. That is, it computes
 * the weights \f$w_1,w_2,w_3 > 0, w_1 + w_2 + w_3 = 1\f$ such that
 *
 * \f$
 * P_{ij} = w_1 \cdot v_1(t_k) + w_2 \cdot v_2(t_k) + w_2 \cdot v_2(t_k)
 * \f$
 *
 * where \f$v_s(t_k)\f$ is the @e s-th vertex of triangle \f$t_k\f$ in the
 * triangulation obtained from the parametrisation.
 *
 * Once all the \f$w_i\f$ are known for each point in the grid, the new
 * mesh is computed: a new 3-dimensional point is made for each point in
 * the grid, using the weights \f$w_1,w_2,w_3\f$ calculated before:
 *
 * \f$
 * Q_{ij} = w_1 \cdot v_1(T_k) + w_2 \cdot v_2(T_k) + w_3 \cdot v_3(T_k)
 * \f$
 *
 * where \f$T_k\f$ denotes the triangle of the original mesh @e m that
 * is mapped to triangle \f$t_k\f$ due to the parametrisation, which is,
 * in turn, the triangle that encloses point \f$P_{ij}\f$.
 * @param[in] m Triangle mesh to be remeshed.
 * @param[in] N Size of the grid in the x-axis.
 * @param[in] M Size of the grid in the y-axis.
 * @param[in] uvs Parametrisation of the input mesh.
 * @param[out] rm Remeshed mesh.
 * @pre The input mesh needs all of its edges computed, namely,
 * neighbourhood data has to be valid.
 * @pre There must be as many 2d points as vertices in the mesh.
 * @pre This function assumes that the parametric space of @e uvs is
 * squared-shaped (they have been computed using @ref boundary_shape::Square).
